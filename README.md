Fish Stock Decline Analysis
ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project analyzes factors contributing to fish stock decline in the Niger Delta using synthetic environmental and fishing activity data.
It demonstrates how data science can be applied to understand ecological challenges and support sustainable fisheries management.

ðŸ“Š Features
Synthetic dataset with 150+ records

Environmental indicators:

Water Quality Index

Fishing Effort (hours/week)

Habitat Loss (%)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pair plots & correlation heatmaps

Linear Regression Model to quantify factor influence on fish stock

Data export to Excel (.xlsx)

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

ðŸ“ˆ Example Insights
Higher fishing effort and habitat loss significantly reduce fish stock.

Poor water quality negatively impacts fish populations.

The model achieves a high RÂ² value indicating strong predictive accuracy.
